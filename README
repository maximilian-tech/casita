CASITA is a tool for automatic analysis of OTF2 trace files that have been 
generated with Score-P. It determines program activities with high impact on the
total program runtime and the load balancing. CASITA generates an OTF2 trace 
with additional information such as the critical path, waiting time, and the
cause of wait states. The same metrics are used to generate a summary profile 
which rates activities according their potential to improve the program runtime 
and the load balancing.
